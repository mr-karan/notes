# notes

Collection of my byte sized notes on programming and other random topics. 

## Local Setup

To preview the site locally:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
make run
```

## Workflow

I write these notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and use [Material for Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) with a bunch of extensions and plugins to publish them at [notes.mrkaran.dev](https://notes.mrkaran.dev).
